    "#Question6: List down some best practices for exception handling in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Use specific exception types: Use specific exception types whenever possible, rather than catching a more general exception \n",
    "    type such as Exception or BaseException. This will make your code more readable and help you handle different types of \n",
    "    errors in a more granular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Keep try blocks small: Try to keep the amount of code in the try block as small as possible. This makes it easier to pinpoint \n",
    "    the exact location of an error and also makes your code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Use finally block: Use the finally block to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, regardless of whether an exception\n",
    "    was thrown or not. This can include closing files, releasing locks, or cleaning up temporary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Use context managers: Use context managers, such as with statements, to ensure that resources are properly managed and cleaned\n",
    "    up automatically. This can help avoid common errors such as forgetting to close a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.Avoid broad try/except blocks: Avoid using broad try/except blocks that catch all exceptions, as this can mask important \n",
    "    errors \n",
    "    and make it harder to debug your code. Instead, catch only the specific exceptions that you expect to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Provide useful error messages: Provide useful error messages that help the user understand what went wrong and how to fix it. \n",
    "    This can include details such as the type of exception, the location of the error, and any relevant context information.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Don't swallow exceptions: Avoid swallowing exceptions by catching them and not doing anything with them. If you catch an \n",
    "exception, you should either handle it in a meaningful way or re-raise it so that it can be handled by another part of your \n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Test your code: Test your code thoroughly to ensure that you have covered all possible exceptions that could occur, and that \n",
    "    your code handles them in the correct way.\n",

    "\n",
